# Snippets

## Introduction

A library with small pieces of code for all kind of things (back-end and front-end).

All the codes inside this repository can be used on your projects, and is just to help you to develop a project more faster or just to remind you how to do some piece of code. Here you will find any kind of code, like: ```Javascript```, ```Ruby```, ```Ruby on Rails```, ```Twitter Bootstrap```, and ```Other``` (that I don't know what put yet :laughing:)

## Folders

All the Snippets are separated with its relative folder, so, if you write a Snippet for a `Twitter Bootstrap` header, for example, you put it on Twitter Bootstrap folder, if is a Ruby code, you put inside `Ruby` folder and this for all the other snippets.

## Structure of a Snippet

### Back-end piece of code example

So, how I should write this Snippet? It is simply. Let's say that I will write a Snippet for some piece of `Ruby` code. For this Snippet I will have the following structure 

```
* Ruby (master folder)
  * Snippet name folder
    * snippet.rb
    * README.md (optional)
```
  
It's simple, isn't it? Yeah, it is. All the Snippets will go inside a Snippet folder with the name you want, with a maximum of 50 characters on the folder name and explaining what is that Snippet. Why only 50 characters? Just for organization for now, but this can be changed in the future if the name is too short (or too long). So, together with the code you can up the Snippet with a README file explaining what you do, or the problems this solve or maybe asking how to improve, and of curse, with the author name and references. 

### Front-end piece of code example

Ok, now we have a Snippet that have HTML and CSS. So, how I do this time? It's simple, again. But we have only one more thing that we need to put together this time, and it is an IMAGE !! :smile: :smile: :smile: . So, now the structure will be more like this:

```
* Twitter Bootstrap (master folder)
  * Snippet name folder
    * snippet.slim
    * snippet.css
    * snippet.png
    * README.md (optional)
```

Ok, but why I need to send an image too? Maybe the right question is: why not? There are people that want to see what this piece of code is before use this, and is for this that an image is important! :blush:
Like in the pure back-end Snippets, you can also up a README with your informations, doubts and motivations to do that Snippet.

### How can I contribute?

We will explain this another time, hahaha. That's all folks!
